# Snowball Securities

**Note:** This starter uses Gatsby v2.

## Prerequisites

Node (we recommend using v8.2.0 or higher)
Gatsby CLI
Netlify CLI

## Getting Started

Netlify CMS can run in any frontend web environment, but the quickest way to try it out is by running it on a pre-configured starter site with Netlify.

## Running Locally

To run the website locally, you'll need run a production build of the site:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ netlify dev # or ntl dev
```

## Using Without Netlify Hosting

```
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve
```
