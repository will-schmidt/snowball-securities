      The whole process can all be handled within our app. It takes just a few
      minutes to fill in your personal information, submit your id and address
      and sign the agreement.  We then verify your ID and you're ready to open
      your account within our app.


      It really is that simple.

      **Option 1** Transfer HK$ to Snowball holding account in Hong Kong 


      **Option 2** Transfer US$ to Snowball holding account in the US


      **Option 3** Transfer NZ$ to Snowball holding account in New Zealand and
      convert it to any currencies to meet trading needs on our APP.


      All options differ in exchange rate and transfer fee charged by banks. We
      recommend that clients transfer with online banking as there are no
      overseas wire fees and transactions normally take only one day to
      complete. Withdrawing funds is the same easy process as a deposit.
