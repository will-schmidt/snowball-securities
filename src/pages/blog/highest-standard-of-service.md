Here at Snowball X we are committed to providing our clients with the highest standard of services, governance, compliance and support. 
Our new purpose, vision and brand identity is less than one year old, but it has quickly helped us developed a strong foundation for future growth and global aspirations. 

We are a solid company with strong shareholders backing which includes Ant Financials (Alibaba), Sequoia Capital, Renren and Morningside. The company has a strong focus on fintechâ€™s latest technology so that we can provide you with the most efficient and effective access to the global market place at your convenience. 

You can access the global market place and market information on one convenient app anywhere in the world. 
Our clients are very important to us. We take our work seriously and we strive to be the best at what we do. To provide you with the very best service, efficient and effective execution, easy to use and cost-effective access to the global markets, and to assist you to secure and grow your investments. 

As I reflect on my first year with Snowball X, and our performance, four things stands out most: firstly the Snowball Group (Xueqiu) platform continues to grow at a strong rate with over 35 million users. Our equities platform has now reached over 100,000 clients and an additional average of 500 new clients weekly. 

The Snowball brand and reputation continues to grow with strength within China and now outside China. Our new focus, vision and strategy will lay a strong foundation for future ventures into the global arena.
Be part of the Snowball X community and grow with us.
