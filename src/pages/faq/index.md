        question: Can tax residents of another country use Snowball X services?
      - answer: >-
          Snowball X is also a member of Snowball Group（“雪球集团”, Snowball).
          Snowball Group's investment and communication platform xueqiu.com is a
          leading investment social network and online trading platform in China
          with over 35 million users. It provides investors with cross-market
          and cross-species data information, news, and interactive
          communication services. These services cover China A shares, Hong
          Kong, and U.S. stock market. 


          Incorporated in 2010, Snowball has raised more than US$170 million in
          four investment rounds since 2014 including US$120 million from
          Alibaba subsidiary, Ant Financial. 
        question: Who owns Snowball X?
      - answer: >-
          With one account, Snowball clients can buy and sell securities in some
          of the world’s largest companies. We are one of the first firms in New
          Zealand to provide Kiwis with access to such a wide range of
          securities markets overseas. The most popular markets for our current
          clients are the SEHK, the NYSE and NASDAQ along with China A-shares -
          shares of mainland China-based companies that trade on the two Chinese
          stock exchanges, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock
          Exchange.
        question: What securities can clients invest in through Snowball X?
      - answer: >-
          To gain exposure to some of the world’s largest companies, achieve
          investment diversification benefits and take advantage of fluctuating
          currency exchange rates.


          A portfolio that includes equities listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, the
          SEHK and other share markets can provide diversification benefits
          because the factors that drive the markets in the United States, Hong
          Kong and elsewhere at any given time are different to those that
          prevail at home. For this reason, spreading risk across different
          markets can help to produce higher risk-adjusted returns.


          Also, there are benefits to investors when exchange rates work in your
          favour. Currency risk, known as exchange-rate risk, arises from the
          change in price of one currency in relation to another.

          I already have an account with other brokers, and want to transfer my
          funds and positions to Snowball X. What should I do?


  - categoryTitle: Margin Trading
    questions:
      - answer: >-
          Margin financing refers to the act of a client who pledges funds or
          stocks in his own account to brokers and borrows more funds from
          brokers to buy stocks. Margin financing plays a role in amplifying
          trading leverage. For example, your principal is 1 million US dollars,
          and borrows 1 million US dollars from the broker, for a total of 2
          million US dollars to buy stocks, this is a 2x leveraged financing. If
          the stock price rises 25%, your return on investment will be 50%. If
          the stock price falls by 25%, your return on investment will be -50%.
          It is recommended that customers utilising margin financing fully
          understands the risk of the service.
        question: What is margin financing?
      - answer: >-
          If you want to make margin financing transactions, you need to open a
          margin account. All the accounts with Snowball Securities are Reg T
          margin accounts, that is, with facilities of margin financing and
          securities financing accounts. 
        question: How to enter margin financing transactions?
      - answer: >-
          Not all the US stocks are available for margin financing purchase. In
          Snowball Securities, a “Financing for Buying” indicator is installed
          for those stocks which are available for margin financing purchase. It
          is shown in the stock page on the data bar. If there is no such
          indicator for one stock, that stock is not available for margin
          financing purchase.
        question: How to check if one stock is available for margin financing purchase?
      - answer: >-
          You can click on "Marginable stocks" on the “US Stocks “page of
          Snowball Securities App to enter the list page of U.S. stocks can be
          margin financing purchased. You may query the initial margin rate,
          maintenance margin rate, overnight margin rate and other requirements
          on each stock in the list.
        question: >-
          How to query the stocks that are available for margin financing
          purchase?
      - answer: >-
          All new accounts with Snowball are defaulted as “Reg T” accounts, that
          is, the most leverage ratio within a day is 4x for US stocks trading.
          For example, the investor has 10,000 USD initial margin in the
          account, and he is able to finance 30,000 USD in maximum and that
          makes up to 40,000 USD in total to be trading from. At the end of
          trading time of the day, the margin funding will be recalled, and the
          investor needs to make sure the leverage is repaid down to the
          overnight limit by then. For overnight funding, the most leverage
          ratio is 2x for US stocks. Therefore, the investor must sell some
          stocks before 3:50pm US ET and repay the margin funding down to 10,000
          USD.


          Accounts with more than USD110,000 could be upgraded to Portfolio
          Margin Account, and be offered with more margin funding. Please
          contact customer service for more information.


          Please be notified that margin funding is all about managing risk.
        question: >-
          How much in maximum can be funded by margin loan for trading US
          stocks?
      - answer: >-
          You can click on "Marginable stocks" on the “US Stocks “page of
          Snowball App, and three indicators showed next to the stock name are:
          a. initial margin rate; b. maintenance margin rate; c. overnight
          margin rate.

          Initial margin rate — the percentage of the purchase price of the
          securities that the investor must deposit into their account.

          Maintenance margin rate — the minimum percentage of deposit that must
          be maintained in the investor’s account.

          Overnight margin rate—addition requirement on the minimum percentage
          of deposit when the stock is held overnight.
        question: How to query the margin funding limit for a stock?
      - answer: >-
          In general, failure to meet margin requirements will result in the
          liquidation of assets. In Snowball Securities app, there is an
          indicator of “risk of liquidation parameter”. You need to be sure the
          parameter remains greater than 0. When the parameter approaches down
          to value of 0, you are alert with higher risk of liquidation. 
        question: What circumstances will trigger my position to be forced to liquidate?
      - answer: >-
          It is demonstrated in the following.


          For example, the in-day maintenance margin rate is 25%, and the
          investor deposits 1m USD and borrows 500,000 USD to buy stock A total
          valued 1.5m USD. The margin is deficient where the stock price falls
          by x(%), makes net equity value equals required margin, where,


          Net equity value= 1500000*(1-x)-500000

          Required margin=1500000*(1-x) *25%


          By solving the equation, x is 55.56%, which means, liquidation is
          triggered when the stock prices fall by 55.56%.
        question: How is the stock price that causes deficient margin calculated?
      - answer: "In the case of a margin violation, the account in deficit is immediately subject to liquidation.\_ Automated liquidations are accomplished with market orders, and any/all positions in the account can be liquidated.\_\_ There are cases where, due to specific market conditions, a deficit is better addressed via a manual liquidation."
        question: >-
          Is the position going to be partly liquidated when the margin goes
          into deficient?
      - answer: "It is the sale of a security that is not owned by the seller\_or that the seller has borrowed from broker. Short selling is motivated by the belief that a security's price will decline, enabling it to be bought back at a lower price to make a profit.\_"
        question: What is securities financing or short selling?
      - answer: >-
          All the accounts with Snowball Securities are Reg T margin accounts,
          that is, with facilities of margin financing and securities financing
          accounts. With deposits equivalent to 3000 US dollars or more, the
          financing facilities are activated.
        question: How to enter securities financing transactions?
      - answer: "Not all the US stocks are available for securities financing sale. In Snowball Securities, a “Financing for short sell” indicator is installed for those stocks which are available for securities financing sale. It is shown in the stock page on the data bar.\_If there is no such indicator for one stock, that stock is not available for securities financing sale."
        question: >-
          How to check if one stock is available for securities financing
          purchase?
      - answer: >-
          You can click on "Marginable stocks" on the “US Stocks “page of
          Snowball Securities App to enter the list page of U.S. stocks can be
